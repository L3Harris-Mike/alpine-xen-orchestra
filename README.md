## What is Alpine Linux?
Alpine Linux is a Linux distribution built around musl libc and BusyBox. The image is only 5 MB in size and has access to a package repository that is much more complete than other BusyBox based images. This makes Alpine Linux a great image base for utilities and even production applications. Read more about Alpine Linux here and you can see how their mantra fits in right at home with Docker images.

## What is Xen Orchestra?
Xen Orchestra provides a web based UI for the management of XenServer installations without requiring any agent or extra software on your hosts nor VMs. The primary goal of XO is to provide a unified management panel for a complete XenServer infrastructure, regardless of pool size and quantity of pools. For those seeking a web based replacement for XenCenter, Xen Orchestra fully supports VM lifecycle operations such as VM creation, migration or console access directly from a browser. Xen Orchestra extends the capabilities of XenCenter to also provide delegated resource access, delta backup, continuous replication, performance graphs and visualisations.

## Environment Variables:

### Main Xen parameters:

* Check the config.yaml file for options, or leave for defaults.

## Creating an instance

A redis container is required, e.g redis:alpine to be linked to the xen orchestra container. Check docker compose example for more info.

### Getting Started

To forward all external traffic from port 80 to the containerâ€™s port 8080

```sh
$ docker run -d --name xen-orchestra -p 80:8080 yobasystems/alpine-xen-orchestra yarn start
```

Point your browser to `http://host-ip`.

## Docker Compose example:

```yalm
version: '2'
services:
    xen-orchestra:
        image: yobasystems/alpine-xen-orchestra:latest
        container_name: xoa
        command: yarn start
        ports:
            - "8000:8080"
        depends_on:
            - redis
        environment:
            - NODE_ENV=production
        volumes:
            - /data/xoa/server:/app/data
    redis:
        container_name: xoa-redis
        image: redis:alpine
        command: redis-server --appendonly yes
        volumes:
            - /data/xoa/redis:/data
